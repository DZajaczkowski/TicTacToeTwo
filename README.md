# TicTacToeTwo

## Why it was created?

* To practice basic java project in Spring REST.
* To improve on a very old TicTacToe project made when I was starting my journey with programming.

## Is the project finished?

* It is currently not finished and on hold, as the weather_API project became higher priority. I will come back to it soon.

## What does it do?

* It is used to play simple games of TicTacToe in Spring Boot.
* It is able to do basic CRUD operations on games and players.
